1.Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
	use my_first_db

2.Create students collection.
   db.createCollection('students')

3.Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
   db.students.insert({ name: "Njomeza", home_state:"Prishtina", lucky_number: 10, birthday: {month: 08, day: 31, year: 1983} })


4.Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
	 db.students.insert([ 
	  {name: "Njomeza", home_state:"Prishtina", lucky_number: 10, birthday: {month: 08, day: 31, year: 1983}},
	  {name: "Rion", home_state:"LA", lucky_number: 5, birthday: {month: 06, day: 21, year: 1980}},
	  {name: "Ana", home_state:"NY", lucky_number: 3, birthday: {month: 05, day: 10, year: 1985}},  
	  {name: "Rea", home_state:"LA", lucky_number: 11, birthday: {month: 03, day: 21, year: 1986}},

	  ])

5.Get all students.
	db.students.find()
 
6.Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
	  db.students.find( { host_name: { $or: [ "California", "Washington" ] } } )
  
7.Get all students whose lucky number is:
greater than 3
less than or equal to 10
between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
	
	db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})
	db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})
	db.students.find({lucky_number:{$gte:1,$lt:10}})
	
8.Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
	db.students.update({},{$set:{interests:['coding','brunch','MongoDB']}})

	

9.Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
	db.students.update({name:'Njomeza'},{$push: {interests:'coding'}})
	db.students.update({name:'Rion'},{$push: {interests:'boxing'}})
	db.students.update({name:'Ana'},{$push: {interests:'analyzing'}})
	db.students.update({name:'Rea'},{$push: {interests:'brunch'}})
	db.students.update({name:'Tom'},{$push: {interests:'MongoDB'}})

	
10.Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
	db.students.update({name:'Ana'},{$push: {interests:'taxes'}})
	
	
11.Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
	db.students.update({name:'Ana'},{$pop: {interests: (1)}})
	
12.Remove all students who are from California.
	db.students.remove({home_state:'California'})
	
13.Remove a student by name. 
	db.students.remove({name:"Njomeza"})
	
	
14.Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
	db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt:5}})
	
15.Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
	db.students.update({},{$set:{number_of_belts:0}})

	
16.Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
	db.students.update({home_state:'Washington'},{$set: {number_of_belts:1}})


17.Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
	db.students.updateMany( {}, { $rename: { "number_of_belts": "belts_earned" }})

18.Remove the 'lucky_number' field.
	db.students.update({},{$unset: {lucky_number:1}},{multi: true});
 

19.Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
	db.students.update({},{$currentDate:{updated_on:true}},{multi:true})
